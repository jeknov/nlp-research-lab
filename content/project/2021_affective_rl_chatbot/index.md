This ongoing project aims to combine the end-to-end inference networks as they are used in chatbot architectures and the affects-based language model.

Affect (emotion) in language plays a critical role in conveying mental and emotional states, along with the information intended to be conveyed. As such, it is important to implement the ability to generate affect-driven and topic focused sentences without losing grammatical correctness in chatbots. At the same time, it is also important to keep the chatbot focused on the specific task of the ongoing conversation.
