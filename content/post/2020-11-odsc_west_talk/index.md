In November 2020, Jekaterina Novikova gave a talk "Solving Real-life Challenges in Detecting Cognitive Diseases from Speech using ML" at the [ODSC West conference.](https://odsc.com/speakers/solving-real-life-challenges-in-detecting-cognitive-diseases-from-speech-using-ml/)

Machine learning (ML) has great potential in detecting cognitive, mental and functional health disorders from speech, as acoustic properties of speech and corresponding patterns in language are modified by a wide variety of health-related effects. However, there exist many real-life problems that make developing ML models a challenging task. In the talk, Jekaterina discusses some of the common challenges researchers are dealing with when developing ML models, such as the lack of appropriate training data, absence of labels, effects of automatic speech recognition, limitations of English-only models and the lack of interpretability. Jekaterina explains how these challenges affect the quality and performance of existing ML models used to detect cognitive diseases from speech and presents novel solutions that are being developed to deal with them.
