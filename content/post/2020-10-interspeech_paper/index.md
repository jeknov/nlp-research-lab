Our paper "To BERT or not to BERT: Comparing Speech and Language-Based Approaches for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Detection" was accepted to the [Interspeech 2020](http://www.interspeech2020.org/About/About_the_Conference/) conference.

Interspeech has grown into the world's largest technical conference focused on speech processing and application with over 1000 attendees and over 600 papers. The conferences emphasize interdisciplinary approaches addressing all aspects of speech science and technology, ranging from basic theories to advanced applications. 

The paper presents the work performed as a submission to the shared ADReSS (Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech) challenge. More details on the papers are in the Publication section. Congratulations to the authors!
