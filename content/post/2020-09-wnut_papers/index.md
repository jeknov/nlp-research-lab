Two our papers were accepted to the Sixth Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text W-NUT at the [EMNLP 2020](https://2020.emnlp.org/) conference:

- [Fantastic Features and Where to Find Them: Detecting Cognitive Impairment with a Subsequence Classification Guided Approach.](https://nlp-research-lab.netlify.app/publication/2020_fantastic_features/) By Benjamin Eyre, Aparna Balagopalan, and Jekaterina Novikova
- [Impact of ASR on Alzheimer's Disease Detection: All Errors are Equal, but Deletions are More Equal than Others.](https://nlp-research-lab.netlify.app/publication/2020_asr_impact_on_ad_clf/) By Aparna Balagopalan, Ksenia Shkaruta, and Jekaterina Novikova

The [W-NUT workshop](http://noisy-text.github.io/2020/) is organized since 2015 and focuses on Natural Language Processing applied to noisy user-generated text, such as that found in social media, online reviews, crowdsourced data, web forums, clinical records and language learner essays. 

More details on the papers are in the [Publication](https://nlp-research-lab.netlify.app/publication/) section. Congratulations to the authors!
