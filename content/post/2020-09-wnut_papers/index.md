Two our papers were accepted to the Sixth Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text W-NUT at the EMNLP 2020 conference:

- Fantastic Features and Where to Find Them: Detecting Cognitive Impairment with a Subsequence Classification Guided Approach. By Benjamin Eyre, Aparna Balagopalan, and Jekaterina Novikova
- Impact of ASR on Alzheimer's Disease Detection: All Errors are Equal, but Deletions are More Equal than Others. By Aparna Balagopalan, Ksenia Shkaruta, and Jekaterina Novikova

The W-NUT workshop is organized since 2015 and focuses on Natural Language Processing applied to noisy user-generated text, such as that found in social media, online reviews, crowdsourced data, web forums, clinical records and language learner essays. 

More details on the papers are in the Publication section. Congratulations to the authors!
